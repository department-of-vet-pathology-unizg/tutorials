# Motivation

Our goal is to apply Deep Learning in automating and developing more accurate, faster and less expensive diagnostic procedures in pathology. Deep learning is a set of algorithms that enables a computer to learn something from previous examples, in a way similar to how humans learn. For this reason, in media they are more often called "Artificial Intelligence".

Deep learning has proven to be an extremely effective technique for a broad range of computer vision task. Today, there is a high, unfilled demand for data scientists with a background in medicine. This is because it is often far more important to have a deep understanding of the data than it is to have a PhD in statistics. We hope that students on this project will continue to develop in this field after graduating from VEF. 

It is important to remember that this is first and foremost a student project. To keep our students highly motivated, it is crucial to give them an opportunity to work on meaningful projects. We are always trying to choose problems that are not only important to solve but, once they are solved, can also be tested and used directly for various diagnostic procedures on our department.

We'll be using **Python** as our programming language and **Linux** as OS.


# Python

Our tutorial [Python_Introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/department-of-vet-pathology-unizg/tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/Python_Introduction.ipynb) explains why we are using Python and can also serve as a quick crash course on the Python programming language.


# Linux

In data science, Linux OS is the standard. A majority of data science companies are using Linux as their primary OS. As a result, libraries that we will be using are also more stable and faster on Linux than on Windows. For example, this is a paragraph taken from fast.ai (deep learning library) GitHub page:

"_fastai v1 currently **supports Linux only**, and requires PyTorch v1 and Python 3.6 or later. Windows support is at an experimental stage: it should work fine but it's much slower and less well tested. Since Macs don't currently have good Nvidia GPU support, we do not currently prioritize Mac development._"

Linux is also faster than Windows. Take a look at a [Clear Linux](https://clearlinux.org/), a Linux OS developed by Intel and optimized for deep learning.

# Our Position on Education

There is a profound change in the way how generations that grew up on the Internet define freedom and community. Today's education should reflect that!

The previous generation's definition of freedom was very simple: to be free is to be an autonomous agent, to be independent, to not be beholden to others so that one can have freedom as exclusivity.

For the generations that are now entering higher education, on the other hand, being an island to oneself is death. This generation asks the question: How can I flourish to the full extent of my possibilities? And it is clear that the answer to that is "I flourish to the extent that I'm embedded in the network after network, after network; community after community, where I can share my talents, and those talents can benefit the network and come back to benefit myself. Therefore, for these generations, freedom is not exclusivity, it's not being an autonomous agent. It's inclusivity. It's access to others in networks."

Education should be a shared experience. The teacher is important as a facilitator and guide, but the students have to teach each other. This project is designed in the way to facilitate that process and every student is encouraged to write and publish tutorials that could benefit himself and others.
