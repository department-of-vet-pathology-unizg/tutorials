# Motivation

Our goal is to apply Deep Learning to veterinary pathology.  Deep Learning is a set of algorithms that enables a computer to learn something from previous examples, in a way similar to how humans learn. For this reason, in media they are more often termed "Artificial Intelligence".

Problems can only be solved by people who are familiar with them. Computer scientists wonâ€™t be able to solve the majority of problems in veterinary medicine, but veterinarians can, not just because they are the ones who are confronted with these problems every day, but also because they have the medical expertise needed for collecting and labeling medical images.

In data science, it is often far more important to have a deep understanding of the data than it is to have a PhD in statistics. 
For these reasons, there is a high, unfilled demand for data scientists with a background in medicine. We hope that students on this project will continue to develop in this field after graduating from VEF. 


# Our Position on Education

There is a profound change in the way how generations that grew up on the Internet define freedom and community. Today's education should reflect that!

The previous generation's definition of freedom was very simple: to be free is to be an autonomous agent, to be independent, to not be beholden to others so that one can have freedom as exclusivity.

For the generations that are now entering higher education, on the other hand, being an island to oneself is death. This generation asks the question: How can I flourish to the full extent of my possibilities? And it is clear that the answer to that is "I flourish to the extent that I'm embedded in the network after network, after network; community after community, where I can share my talents, and those talents can benefit the network and come back to benefit myself. Therefore, for these generations, freedom is not exclusivity, it's not being an autonomous agent. It's inclusivity. It's access to others in networks."

Education should be a shared experience. The teacher is important as a facilitator and guide, but the students have to teach each other. This project is designed in the way to facilitate that process and every student is encouraged to write and publish tutorials that could benefit himself and others.
